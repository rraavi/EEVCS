<h2>Overview</h2>
This applet was written at the JP iNFOTeCH
Goal of this Applet is to demonstrate the wide range and
mightiness of the Embedded Extended Visual Cryptography Schemes.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So what is Visual Cryptography?</span><br>
Visual cryptography was introduced by Moni Naor und Adi Shamir in 1994.
This new type of cryptographic scheme, which is perfectly secure,
can decode concealed images
without any cryptographic computations by the human visual system. For
a example take a try of this Applet.

<h2><a name="functionality">Functionality</a></h2>
This Applet offers different schemes (e.g. 2 out of n, 3 out of n, 2
out of 2 colored, 2 out of 2 greyscaled) which are used to encode
an image, which contains 100*100 pixel.<br>
<h3><a name="gui">Graphical User Interface</a></h3>
<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:5px;"><img src="./overview.jpg" alt="overview over applet" width="400" height="400"></div>
The GUI is splitted into 3 sections. The top section contains the
original image and a short description of the used scheme.
The section in the middle includes the encrypted images. If there are
only two transparencies, the two images are displayed. In other cases
only one image is displayed and you get a control element for switching
between the transparencies.
The lower section displays the result of overlaying some encrypted
images, whereby you can specify whith the checkboxes which images shall
be overlayed.<br>
Every section can be flipped by clicking on the arrow in the left upper corner.

<h3><a name="menu">Menu</a></h3>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="./menu.jpg" alt="menu" width="320" height="16"></div>
<h4>File</h4>
All save and load operations support only the *.gif and *.png format.
	<h5>Load image:</h5> opens a dialog where you can select your own image, 
		which shall be used as input for the Visual Cryptography. Please be sure that 
		the permissions for the Applet are set and the image has 100*100 pixel.
	<h5>Load encrypted transparencies</h5> opens a dialog whithin you can select
		encrypted images and load them into the Applet. Be aware that you have chosen
		the right scheme for the images and that all images have the same correct size.
	<h5>Save current transparency</h5> opens a dialog to save the selected transparency. 
		A transparency is selected by left-clicking with the mouse on an image. You see this
		by the blue border around the selected transparency. You also can select the transparency
		of the lower section. Please be sure to have setted the right permissions.
	<h5>Save all transparencies</h5> calls a dialog to save all transparencies.
	<h5>Print</h5> opens a printer diaolog and prints out the current transparency.
	<h5>Exit</h5> quits the programm.
<h4>Mode</h4>
enables you to switch between the different modes of the Visual Cryptography.
	<h5>Basic 2 out of n</h5>all schemes related to 2 out of n
	<h5>Basic 3 out of n</h5>all schemes related to 3 out of n
	<h5>Extended modes</h5>some special features: see the description of this mode for
		further information.
<h4>Visual Cryptography</h4>
	<h5>Generate encrypted transparencies</h5> starts the process of reading the original
		image and creating the encrypted transparancies.
<h4>Show</h4>
enables you to show the transparency nr. xx if there are more than 2 transparencies.
<h4>Result</h4>
enables you to specify which transparancies should be overlayed. You can also do this in
the lower section with the checkboxes.
<h4>Info</h4>
	<h5>Help</h5> shows this help file. You alternatively can press the key 'F1' to access this help.
	<h5>About</h5> shows a short information of this applet.

<h3><a name="toolbar">Toolbar</a></h3>
<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:5px;"><img src="./toolbar.jpg" alt="toolbar" width="400" height="29"></div>
The toolbar contains mostly the same functions as given in the Menu. From left to right:
	<h5>Load image</h5>
	<h5>Load encrypted transparencies</h5>
	<h5>Save current transparency</h5>
	<h5>Save all transparencies</h5>
	<h5>encrypt</h5>starts the process of generating encrypted transparencies.
	<h5>Zoom</h5> opens a new window and displays the currently selected transparency twice as big
		as in the normal view.
	<h5>1,2,3,4,5</h5>enables you to select the displayed transparency. In addition to that
		the currently displayed transparency is marked.
